Interviewer: You're about to see more of a how-not than a how-to, so with that in mind, please enjoy this dramatization of a customer discovery interview.

[0:37]

Interviewer: Good to see you.

Interviewee: Thank you so much for making it.

Interviewer: No problem. I think professional development is super important, I'm happy to help with whatever you need.

[0:45]

Interviewer: You wanna have a seat over at the table here?

Interviewee: You sit here.

Interviewer: Oh, there you are, sir.

[0:55]

Interviewer: So we're working on an application that lets you assess the skill sets required for a given role and where a given employee is on those skill sets. The purpose of this is to be able to plan for professional development as things change and you change technologies and you want to help your talent develop.

^ (Background or context)

[1:16]

Interviewer: This is something—I’m an HR manager myself before I started this—and really, my inspiration for all this was that we had a bunch of big platform and technology changes that happened at the same time. The manager said, "Whoa, we need a way to assess where our teams are in this so that they can have time to ramp up on these new things and they don't get overwhelmed and overworked."

☇ (Pain or problem: "They don't get overwhelmed and overworked")

⨅ (Goal or job-to-be-done: "We need a way to assess where our teams are")

[1:38]

Interviewer: And so that's really this friction, and I was just hoping to ask you a few questions about this.

Interviewee: Sure.

[1:40]

Interviewer: Alright, how important is lifelong learning and professional development to your company?

Interviewee: It's very important. We have a lot of technologies here.

Interviewer: I'm just gonna take notes.

Interviewee: Oh, okay, thanks. Yeah, um, new technologies we're using—people have to learn all this new stuff all the time, and it's just never-ending.

☇ (Pain or problem: "People have to learn all this new stuff all the time, and it's just never-ending")

[2:03]

Interviewer: Would you say it's one of your top priorities?

Interviewee: Um, yeah, that and recruiting. I'm—you know, we're constantly trying to get people with all the right skills in the right place.

⨅ (Goal or job-to-be-done: "We're constantly trying to get people with all the right skills in the right place")

[2:17]

Interviewer: And have you undergone any platform changes, technology changes that would have necessitated such a plan?

Interviewee: Yeah, we're constantly changing systems around here—new software, new procedures—and it would be great to have people up to date on stuff. And so yes, basically, uh, yeah.

☇ (Pain or problem: "We're constantly changing systems around here")

⨅ (Goal or job-to-be-done: "It would be great to have people up to date on stuff")

[2:37]

Interviewer: And would you be interested in using a third-party tool to assess where people are and how to plan those things?

Interviewee: Sure.

[2:46]

Interviewer: Okay. And if you were to use a tool like that, how much would you be willing to pay?

Interviewee: Um, I don't know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to make that decision.

☐ (Obstacle: "I'm not sure I'm the right person to make that decision")

[2:58]

Interviewer: Well, does five dollars per user per month seem reasonable for something like that?

Interviewee: Um, it doesn't seem unreasonable, but again, I'm not the right person.

＄ (Money or budgets or purchasing process)

[3:08]

Interviewer: And roughly how many people do you have working across software development, IT, and project?

Interviewee: Oh, we have 1,200 people here, so in all the different departments. I don't work with all of them, but across all our departments.

^ (Background or context: Company size and departments)

[3:25]

Interviewer: And if you were gonna use such a tool, what technologies and platforms would you want to be able to assess? This is just for us to kind of plan.

Interviewee: Okay, um, a lot of our engineers use JavaScript, Node in particular. They're on Macs, Windows, Google Apps, third-party apps. We have proprietary apps that we have here, so it's a huge range.

♀ (Mentioned specific technologies and platforms: JavaScript, Node, Macs, Windows, Google Apps)

☑ (Feature request or purchasing criteria: Technologies to be assessed)

[3:51]

Interviewer: Got it. And what features would you want in such a product?

Interviewee: Well, because security's important, the ability to change passwords—we had a huge software change because we had this program where everybody had to come to me to get their password changed; they couldn't just do it over email. So I don't want that to happen again.

☇ (Pain or problem: "Everybody had to come to me to get their password changed")

☑ (Feature request: "The ability to change passwords")

☐ (Obstacle: "I don't want that to happen again")

[4:13]

Interviewee: And people ask me for reports all the time, so I like to export to Excel and do stuff with my reports in there, so that would be important.

☑ (Feature request: "Export to Excel")

⨅ (Goal or job-to-be-done: "Do stuff with my reports")

[4:24]

Interviewer: And what e-learning services do you use at present?

Interviewee: Um, we use Coursera; engineers use Stack Overflow to get, you know, questions and answers, tips, but we don't...

♀ (Mentioned specific companies: Coursera, Stack Overflow)

[4:40]

Interviewer: And do you think that it's useful to plan this stuff and assess it in the future?

Interviewee: Sure.

Interviewer: And do you think people at your company would use such an application?

Interviewee: Um, I don't see why not.

[4:58]

Interviewer: Great. So if you don't mind, I was just hoping to show you a couple of prototypes, just kind of have you react to them.

Interviewee: Okay, cool.

:| (Possible hesitation or neutrality)

[5:05]

Interviewer: This is the first one. I'll give you a second to kind of take it in, and on a scale of one to ten, how likely would you be to use this?

Interviewee: Um, it looks nice, it looks like you put a lot of work into it—probably eight.

☑ (Feature request or purchasing criteria: Positive feedback on the prototype)

[5:21]

Interviewer: And then I just have one more I'm gonna show you.

Interviewer: Okay, and how about this one?

Interviewee: Um, this one looks good too, but I think I like the other one better, so maybe a seven.

☑ (Feature request or purchasing criteria: Preference between prototypes)

[5:35]

Interviewer: Got it. Well, thank you so much for making the time.

Interviewee: No problem, super nice to meet you.
